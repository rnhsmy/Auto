          <h1>Things I love to do</h1>
          <p>Moreover, in this paragraph, I will talk about my hobbies, activities I enjoy and my forms of entertainment.
            <ul>
             <li>
               First, I will talk about some of my hobbies. In my spare time, I am learning how to program. I am learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python. These languages are helping me understand computers better. With these languages, I can make websites, create games or make applications.
             </li>
             <br>
             <br>
             <li>
               Second, I will talk about some activities I enjoy. In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer, bike riding and reading. Playing soccer is a good way to get rid of energy and to have fun. Bike riding is also very fun and a great way to experience the outdoors. Reading is relaxing as it helps me gain more creativity and knowledge in this world.
             </li>
             <br>
             <br>
             <li>
                Lastly, I want to talk about my forms of entertainment. In my spare time I sometimes listen to music. Listening to music is very relaxing and makes boring activities fun. Also sometimes I watch youtube. Youtube is a great way to educate and entertain yourself as there many creators on youtube that promote that do that.
             </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="box2-2">
          <h1> Pet peeves  </h1>
          <p>Furthermore, I want to talk about some of the things that bug or annoy me, or in other words now I will talk about my pet peeves.
            <ul>
              <li>
               First of all one thing I hate is the sound of someone scratching chalk or their hands on a blackboard. I think the sound produced is ear-piercing and stinging to my ears .
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                 Another thing that is annoying is when people scratch their fork against their plate. I think this sound is ear-piercing and annoying.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                 Secondly, my other pet peeve is when people when people talk too much. I think this is annoying as it wastes time. Another one related to this is when people take too long to explain something or pause too much in between their speech. I think this is time-wasting and annoying.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Another pet peeve I have is when people sneeze or cough without covering their mouths. This is inconsiderate as people could get sick when you do this.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                 Also, another pet peeve I have is that I don’t like it when people say “no offence” as if it downplays there insult. This pet peeve is annoying as a lot of people use this.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Lastly another pet peeve that I have are people who talk over me in the middle of my sentence. This pet peeve is considered rude and is annoying.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h1>Oops, I goofed!</h1>
          <p class="box3-content">In this chapter, I will talk about the silliest, stupidity and the funniest thing I’ve ever done. I will also try to add as much detail as possible. My first experience is I once upon a time when I seven I wanted to have some warm milk, so I took a metal cup with a plastic handle, filled it with milk and then put it in the microwave for 30 seconds. I opened the microwave and saw that the metal cup was on fire. I didn’t know what to do so I panicked. Then suddenly my dad came into the room and saw what happened. He ran quickly and got a towel and then tried to blow away the fire. That didn’t work and ended up throwing the cup in the sink and put the tap on. The fire disappeared in a blink of an eye. This is one stupid thing that happened to me when I was young. Another thing is once upon a time when I was four,  my mom was cutting strawberries and I was there on the table. My mom left the room and I was still on the table. I saw some soap and randomly decided to put it on the strawberries. My mom came back and she was wondering why the strawberries were bubbling. My mom concluded that it was me who put the soap in the strawberries. To this day I am surprised that I did this and I still don’t believe this story my mom told me. This is another stupid thing I did when I was young. Another stupid thing I used to do is that I used to chew on the carpet. Also, they said that my brother ate paper. This is another silly thing I did. Another silly thing I did is once I stuffed my mouth with raisins and my parents had to help me take out the raisins. This is another silly thing I did when I was young. From these stories, I know that when I was younger I was probably crazy and stupid at the time. But I have learnt a lot and now I know right from wrong. So in conclusion, these are four stupid and silly things I did when I was young. Next, let’s talk move on our 9th chapter.

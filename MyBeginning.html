          <h1>In the beginning</h1>
          <p>Moreover, this section is about my life as a preschool child and today I will tell you some of my experiences and stories.
            <ul>
              <li>
              First of all, I remember when I was younger I wanted to be a spy because when I was young, I really liked Tom Cruise and his movie series “Mission Impossible”. As I grew older, I began to take an interest in other things, such as technology and books, and began to despise the idea of becoming a spy. Now, today, I want to be a programmer or a piano teacher.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
               Secondly, I really did not like school when I was younger, as I remember times where I would cry just to get out of that place. When I was in Junior Kindergarten in Riyadh, I remember when my dad would drop me off and then when he left, I would run to the door and the teacher would have to stop me from escaping from the classroom. Also, I remember a time when I ran for the door, but for some reason, I knocked a board game off a shelf and my teacher got really mad at me, and she had to put me on the floor.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                These are some of my experiences in school. Also, when I was young, I had  developed a phobia of spiders and bugs. Since we lived in Riyadh, there were a lot of bugs and I would always be scared.
              </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="box2-1">
          <h1>School days, dear old schools days </h1>
          <p>Moving on, in this section we will talk about school days..
            <ul>
               <li>
                 First of all, I want to talk about my feeling about school.
                 In my first day of school, I often feel very nervous and scared as the new school year arrives. I often meet some familiar faces on the first day of school. These faces often become future friends. School can be very stressful especially on the first day.
               </li>
               <br>
               <li> <!--Add a nested list if you want-->
               Today I want to talk about my first day of middle school. On my first day, I remember approaching the red building that will be my future school. I walked in as I saw some familiar faces from my school. The air was filled with nervousness and a feeling of fear as I approached my new school. I began to sit down and wait for my name to be called. Finally, after waiting for minutes which felt like hours, my name was finally called. I walked into my classroom and saw my new teacher whom I would have for 3 years. This was the beginning of a long journey through middle school.
               </li>
               <br>
               <li>
                  Next, I wannt to talk about my future in school. I am worried that school will become harder as we will get more pressure to make more important decisions in our young lives. Also, I am really scared and excited about high school to begin. I am nervous that I will do bad in high school and will not make the right decisions. I am also excited to face my upcoming future as I find this as an opportunity to learn new things and meet new people like me. I am excited in knowing that we will have more freedom in making our decisions in things such as course selection. One course I am really excited for is the Computer Science course in Rick Hansen as I love computers!

          <h1>Oops, I goofed!</h1>
          <p class="box3-content">In this chapter, I will talk about the silliest, stupidity and the funniest thing I’ve ever done. I will also try to add as much detail as possible. My first experience is I once upon a time when I seven I wanted to have some warm milk, so I took a metal cup with a plastic handle, filled it with milk and then put it in the microwave for 30 seconds. I opened the microwave and saw that the metal cup was on fire. I didn’t know what to do so I panicked. Then suddenly my dad came into the room and saw what happened. He ran quickly and got a towel and then tried to blow away the fire. That didn’t work and ended up throwing the cup in the sink and put the tap on. The fire disappeared in a blink of an eye. This is one stupid thing that happened to me when I was young. Another thing is once upon a time when I was four,  my mom was cutting strawberries and I was there on the table. My mom left the room and I was still on the table. I saw some soap and randomly decided to put it on the strawberries. My mom came back and she was wondering why the strawberries were bubbling. My mom concluded that it was me who put the soap in the strawberries. To this day I am surprised that I did this and I still don’t believe this story my mom told me. This is another stupid thing I did when I was young. Another stupid thing I used to do is that I used to chew on the carpet. Also, they said that my brother ate paper. This is another silly thing I did. Another silly thing I did is once I stuffed my mouth with raisins and my parents had to help me take out the raisins. This is another silly thing I did when I was young. From these stories, I know that when I was younger I was probably crazy and stupid at the time. But I have learnt a lot and now I know right from wrong. So in conclusion, these are four stupid and silly things I did when I was young. Next, let’s talk move on our 9th chapter.

          <h1>I’d like to change the world </h1>
          <p>In this section, I want to talk about some stuff that worries me the most and stuff that I want to change in the world:
            <ul>
              <li>
                First I am worried about global warming. I am worried that eventually this world will crumble and fall into nothing. Also, I am also concerned that maybe the people in this world will become selfish as resources fail and people will want them for themselves.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Second, I am also concerned that the people in this world will pollute this world to the brink of our own extinction.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li> Third I am worried about the morals of this world. I am worried that the violence and depravity of this world will increase at a never-ending rate and eventually we will have to live in this horrible world.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                 Fourth I am also worried about my future as I get a job in this world. I am worried that maybe I won’t be able to get a job because of overpopulation and automation.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                But instead of focusing on these problems I want to focus on what I can do as a person of this in this world. Now I want to talk about what I can change to make this world a better person. If I could change something in this world I would change the way people view things. I would try to make everyone on the same page as then people can communicate better and do better things together. For example, if people united then maybe we could stop common problems in the world such as war and conflict. Also if we unite then maybe we can learn how to share and spread our resource.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                I am fairly sure that if we apply these, then maybe we can solve a lot of the problems in this world.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box2-3">
          <h1>Around the world</h1>
          <p>Finally here is my last chapter. In this chapter, I will talk about some of my personal experiences of being in another country:
            <ul>
               <li>
                 In my life, I have been to over 15 countries and have been all over the world.
               </li>
               <br>
               <li>
                First I want to talk about my trip to New York this summer. We travelled to New York on a bus with some friends. It took around 10 hours to get there. The trip there was fun as we took breaks like every hour or so. I also brought some toys and other stuff to keep me entertained during the trip. In New York, we travelled around the city and saw many sites such as; the U.N headquarters, the 9/11 memorial and museum, Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, Statue of Liberty and Times Square. These sites in New York were Awesome!
               </li>
               <br>
               <li>
                 Second I want to talk about my trips to Europe. I have been to many countries in Europe and now I want to talk about some of my Experiences there. I remember when my family and I visited London, England we went to a lot of museums such as the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. I really liked the Natural History Museum because they had fossils of ancient creatures also they had animatronic dinosaurs. Those were really cool and I thought they were real dinosaurs because they looked so natural and alive. Also when we went to Germany we visited a concentration camp. This camp was scary to me back then as I remember looking through a window and seeing a room full of human skulls. We also saw videos of life in the camp which looked horrible and inhumane. That was one experience in my life that I will never forget.
               </li>
               <br>
               <li>
                 Another time we went to South Africa and we went to an African Lion Safari and saw real animals. It was really cool. We went to a caged vehicle and saw lions, cheetahs, buffalo and other animals. I remember one of the lions came right in front of the door of the van and just stared at us for a minute or so. That moment was really scary as I thought the lion would break in the van. We also saw penguins in South Africa. They were really small and cool.
               </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>

         <div class="travel">
          <h1>Around the world - More</h1>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The last trip I want to talk about is my trip to Greece. When I was at Greece we visited a lot of sites and places such as the Delphi Theatre and The Pantheon. These sites I visited about were very interesting to me and I still remember them to this day.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Next, I want to talk about my life in other countries. During my life, I lived in Saudi Arabia and Egypt and now Canada. From there I travelled to a lot of other countries that I mentioned above.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
               During my stay in Saudi Arabia, we lived in the capital city, Riyadh, and during my stay in Egypt, we also stayed in the capital New Cairo. We lived there for a total of six years. Riyadh was a very hot place as it is located in a desert. The heat in Riyadh was dry heat instead of the humid heat in Cairo. I remember times where the temperature reached 50 degrees Celsius! The sun was often so bright that the ground would sparkle in brightness and would blind you. Also, the cars were like ovens. When you entered them all the heat would escape and scorch you in the process. Also after that was over then when you attempted to put your belt established on than the hot metal would burn and sting your hands as the metal of the seat belt absorbed a lot of the heat trapped in the car. Here is some background information about the heat in Riyadh and Cairo.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
               Next, I want to talk about the shopping malls in Riyadh and Cairo. The shopping malls were huge with a lot of shops along the side. The food court was also really large with a lot of restaurants along the side of the food courts. Also, the best part about the malls was that they have rides and an amusement park basically inside the mall. They had roller coasters, arcade’s, mazes and other stuff. That was the only time I actually liked shopping for items.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Also, the schools in Riyadh and Egypt were different as they ranged from kindergarten to grade 12. These schools had multiple buildings schools and were much bigger as they contained all the grades. Also in Riyadh and Egypt the schools were surrounded by walls and they were guards at every entrance and exit. The schools there felt more like fortresses than schools as there was a lot of protection. The amount of protection was probably because Riyadh and Cairo was not a safe place as there were terrorist groups nearby.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Lastly I want to talk about my dream vacation. My dream vacation would want to be a perfect, beautiful place, that had no flaws and no corruption. But one problem is that thinking about this place would be impossible, as it’s hard to think about a perfect place in an imperfect world. Even though it is hard to think about a perfect world, we can still keep it as a thought of hope in our minds that maybe one day that will happen. That day would be a dream come true.

          <h1>Oops, I goofed!</h1>
          <p class="box3-content">In this chapter, I will talk about the silliest, stupidity and the funniest thing I’ve ever done. I will also try to add as much detail as possible. My first experience is I once upon a time when I seven I wanted to have some warm milk, so I took a metal cup with a plastic handle, filled it with milk and then put it in the microwave for 30 seconds. I opened the microwave and saw that the metal cup was on fire. I didn’t know what to do so I panicked. Then suddenly my dad came into the room and saw what happened. He ran quickly and got a towel and then tried to blow away the fire. That didn’t work and ended up throwing the cup in the sink and put the tap on. The fire disappeared in a blink of an eye. This is one stupid thing that happened to me when I was young. Another thing is once upon a time when I was four,  my mom was cutting strawberries and I was there on the table. My mom left the room and I was still on the table. I saw some soap and randomly decided to put it on the strawberries. My mom came back and she was wondering why the strawberries were bubbling. My mom concluded that it was me who put the soap in the strawberries. To this day I am surprised that I did this and I still don’t believe this story my mom told me. This is another stupid thing I did when I was young. Another stupid thing I used to do is that I used to chew on the carpet. Also, they said that my brother ate paper. This is another silly thing I did. Another silly thing I did is once I stuffed my mouth with raisins and my parents had to help me take out the raisins. This is another silly thing I did when I was young. From these stories, I know that when I was younger I was probably crazy and stupid at the time. But I have learnt a lot and now I know right from wrong. So in conclusion, these are four stupid and silly things I did when I was young. Next, let’s talk move on our 9th chapter.

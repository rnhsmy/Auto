            <h1>I want to be me</h1>
            <p> First of all, let’s get to know a bit about me:
              <ul>
                <li>
                    My name is Ryan Harris Massey. I was born on March 10, 2005, and my place of birth was Mississauga, Canada. I was born in Trillium hospital like many others in this class.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Next, I want to consider some facts you probably didn’t know about me. For example, my name means “little king”. Also, my middle name was named after my great grandpa - Harris Massey.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  When I was five, I travelled to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and stayed there for the next five years. Riyadh was a great
                  place and I will talk more about this later.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  I also went to Cairo, Egypt, for a year. It was also a good place and I will also talk about this later too. I travelled to a lot of places while I was in Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Later, I came back to Canada when I was eleven to live with our grandparents. So far, my life in Canada is going pretty well.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
           </div>

          <div class="box2">
            <h1>The real me </h1>
            <p>Next, I want to talk about the real me. In this section, I will talk about my personality, my beliefs and my opinions:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I believe as a person we should all respect people and treat them all the same. I also believe that to gain respect you should show it to others.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  I also believe in the Bible and think that it is the word of God. My personality follows the Bible's guidelines and rules as I try my best to show that. I also think that as a person that we should all get along and try to unite, instead of divide. Even though people can be challenging and tough we should try our best to accept everyone and face their challenges as our own.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  I also think that everyone in this world has a job. Everyone in this world has a role in society. Everyone has a role of helping others and to all be on the page. Even though everyone has different opinions we should all consider each other. These are some of opinions and beliefs. Even though many might disagree that doesn’t matter as it is there choice - and I think everyone has a right to choose what he or she wants to be.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </div>


          <div class="box3">
            <h1>Oops, I goofed!</h1>
            <p class="#">
              In this section, I will talk about the silliest, stupidest and the funniest thing I’ve ever done. I will also try to add as much detail as possible:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  My first experience is once when I was around seven, I wanted to have some warm milk. So I took a metal cup with a plastic handle, filled it with milk and then put it in the microwave for 30 seconds. I opened the microwave and saw that the metal cup was on fire! I didn’t know what to do so I panicked. Then suddenly my dad came into the room and saw what happened. He ran quickly and got a towel and then tried to blow away the fire. That didn’t work and he ended up throwing the cup in the sink and put the tap on. The fire disappeared in a blink of an eye. This is one stupid thing that happened to me when I was young.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Another thing is once upon a time when I was four, my mom was cutting strawberries and I was there on the        table. My mom left the room and I was still on the table. I saw some soap and randomly decided to put it on the   strawberries. My mom came back and she was wondering why the strawberries were bubbling. My mom concluded that    was me who put the soap in the strawberries. To this day I am surprised that I did this and I still don’t         believe this story my mom told me.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Another stupid thing I used to do is that I used to chew on the carpet. Also, my parents said that my brother ate paper.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Lastly another silly thing I did is once I stuffed my mouth with raisins and my parents had to help me take out the raisins.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </div>
       </div>
     </div>
